		<h1>About UpLearn</h1>
		<br>

		<div class="col-md-10">

			<p>The original <a href="https://uplearn.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">UpLearn application</a> was a pure Rails app that I built earlier this year. I'm rebuilding that app here, using AngularJS on the front-end and a Rails API as the back-end.</p>

			<p>The code for this app is <a href="https://github.com/benlcollins/uplearn_angular_rails" target="_blank">
				here on GitHub</a>.</p>
		
			<p>Early days so not at feature parity yet. As I build the app, I'm keeping track of the known bugs and quirks here:</p><br>

			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">Search results on home page always has title "Latest" becuase of the $first variable with ng-repeat</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Cannot get bootstrap glyphicons to play ball with the Rails asset pipeline</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Upvote/downvote buttons not fully functional - need to tie to a user in database</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Highlighted active link in menu is not dynamic, so always highlights "Home" link</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">When nobody logged in, system throws an error becuase of empty user {}</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Bootstrap Nav Bar disappears below 767px width</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Logout on homepage and then immediately trying to log back in throws this error:
					"422 (Unprocessable Entity)". Logging out from other pages does not cause this issue.</li>
